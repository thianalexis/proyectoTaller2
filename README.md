# Data Science Project Template

Welcome to our Data Science Project Template, a streamlined foundation for kick-starting your data science endeavors. This repository is designed to provide an efficient, reproducible, and easy-to-use framework for data science projects of any scale.

Our template leverages a Makefile to automate various tasks associated with setting up and maintaining a data science project environment. The Makefile is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of managing dependencies, virtual environments, and other routine tasks, allowing you to focus on the core aspects of your data analysis.
